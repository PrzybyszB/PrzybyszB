<h1 id="header" align="center">## Hi there 👋</h1>
<p align="justify">Hello, my name it's Bartek and I'm self taught beginner programmer</p>
<p align="justify">My interest in programming began in 2022. I started with Python and with friends we started project named Lamprey. That was a hard project for me, begginer. </p>
<p align="justify">Since February 2024 I’ve been dedicating all my free time to improving my programming skills and building personal projects.</p>
<p align="justify">Although I haven’t pursued a formal degree, I actively study computer science theory because I believe it's the foundation of strong software development.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>MY GOAL: TO BECOME A FULL-TIME PYTHON DEVELOPER</b></p>
